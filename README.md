# Project FINE

Project FINE is a web application which aims to allow people to keep track of their happiness. As someone who suffers from depression, it is very difficult for me to tell whether certain treatments are actually helping me get better. Bringing this issue up with my therapist, he suggested that a simple way to see if there have been progress is to simply keep track of your happiness levels, which is the motivation behind the project.
